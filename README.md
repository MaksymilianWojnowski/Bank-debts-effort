# Which Debts Are Worth the Bank's Effort? 

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Python-based analysis presented in a Jupyter Notebook. It includes detailed explanations and instructions in markdown cells, alongside Python code snippets in code cells, covering various aspects of the project. Project was a part of a DataCamp course.

## Features

- Detailed analysis steps or computational processes demonstrated in 9 code cells.
- Descriptive and instructional content in 9 markdown cells.
- Visualizations and results showcased in 9 output cells.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Additional Python libraries as required by the notebook (pandas, matplotlib, scipy.stats, statsmodel)
